                <h3>Who to look out for in Gameweek 16</h3>
            </div>
                <div>
                    <p>With Gameweek 16 quickly approaching and the World cup wildcard after that. we take a look at how to approach GW16 in order to optimise your chances of improving your rank.<br><br>First off, we must note that due to the world cup and the unlimited transfers you get over that period, you must use your transfers this week if you do not want to lose them. But who should you get in?</p>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <h4>Kaptain Kane:</h4> 
                   <p>Yes that's right there's a challenger to the Haaland captain role in Harry Kane, with the second best xp in the whole of FPL this season and coming up against a defensively shakey Leeds United, there's every chance that Harry Kane can return for you. Even if you choose to captain Haaland, bringing Kane in (if you can afford it) looks like a smart choice as a premium pick due to the vast amount of high scoring, cheap midfielders this season. This is why Kane is our top pick for GW16, but who else could you get?</p>
                   <br>
                   <H4>Adding to your Arsenal:</H4>
                   <p>Arsenal come up against Wolves this weekend, the lowest scoring team in the prem, so we recommend an Arsenal defender. Specifically one of three; Gabriel, White or Saliba, with Gabriel being our top pick and White a close second. Ultimately it is unlikely that any of the three get a goal or assist so you're really looking for the clean sheet points but with Wolves having a new manager there's every chance they could start scoring so having double Arsenal defence this weekend does come with some uncertainty.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h4>Rash decisions can come good:</h4>
                   <p>Marcus Rashford is the third and final pick to look out for this weekend as he comes up against Fulham. Fulham have the worst expected goals conceded this season, meaning the likelihood for a goal fest is high and if I had to bet on who would be most likely to score for Manchester United it would be Marcus Rashford. With an xp of 4.28, he is the best performing Manchester United player this season and coming off the back of a humiliating defeat to Aston Villa Rashford will want to set the record straight at Craven Cottage and I fully expect him to do so.</p>
